# predicting-rainfall-machine-learning
 
This is the repository for a project I implemented in a Machine Learning course at UCF. The goal was to use rainfall data which was present in the form of various metrics that included maximum wind, surface temperature, wind pressure etc and predict whether it rained on a particular day. These acted as features for a point in a precipitation dataset with two classes. Two supervised machine learnig methods were used that included k nearest neigbors and support vector machines using scikit-learn. Principal Component Analysis was also carried out to evaluate the correlation bewteen the features and the cumulative effect on the class prediction.
